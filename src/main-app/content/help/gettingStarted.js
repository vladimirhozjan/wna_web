    title: 'What is GTD?',
    description:
      'Getting Things Done (GTD) is a productivity methodology by David Allen. The core idea is simple: your mind is for having ideas, not holding them. By capturing everything that has your attention into a trusted external system, clarifying what each item means, and organizing the results into clear categories, you free up mental space to focus and engage with your work. WhatsNextAction is built from the ground up around these principles.',

      'Tap "Start Free" on the landing page to open the registration dialog. Enter your email, choose a password (at least 8 characters with a letter, a digit, and a symbol), and confirm it. Once registered you are automatically logged in and taken to your Dashboard. You can also sign in from the "Sign In" button if you already have an account.',

    title: 'Your First Five Minutes',
    description:
      'Open your Inbox and do a brain dump — type everything on your mind and press Enter after each one. Tasks, ideas, errands, reminders, things you need to buy, calls to make — get it all out. Don\'t think about organizing, just capture. Once you have a handful of items, tap the Clarify button at the top. The app will walk you through each item step by step, helping you decide what it is and where it belongs.',

    title: 'The Five Steps of GTD',
    description:
      '1. Capture — Collect everything into your Inbox using Quick Add or the Inbox input. 2. Clarify — Process each item: is it actionable? Is it one step or many? Can you do it in two minutes? 3. Organize — The Clarify wizard places items into Next Actions, Projects, Calendar, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, or Reference. 4. Reflect — Do a Weekly Review to keep your system current and complete. 5. Engage — Work from your Next Actions and Today lists with confidence that nothing is falling through the cracks.',

    title: 'Understanding Your Dashboard',
    description:
      'After logging in you land on the Engage page — your command center. It shows your Today actions, a snapshot of Next Actions, your Waiting For items, and nudges when your Inbox needs clarifying or projects are missing a next action. If anything is overdue, a red alert appears at the top. Use this page to decide what to work on right now.',

    title: 'Navigating the App',
    description:
      'The sidebar (or slide-in drawer on mobile) is your main navigation. Each section maps to a GTD bucket: Inbox, Next Actions, Today, Calendar, Projects, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, Reference, Completed, and Trash. Count badges next to each item show how many items are in that bucket. The Context Filter at the top of the sidebar lets you focus all lists on a single context like @office or @home.',

    title: 'Quick Add — Capture From Anywhere',
    description:
      'The Quick Add button (+) in the top navigation bar lets you capture a thought without leaving whatever page you\'re on. Tap it, type your item, and press Enter. It goes straight to your Inbox as unprocessed stuff. The input stays open so you can rapid-fire multiple items — press Escape when you\'re done.',
  },
  {
    title: 'From Stuff to Action',
    description:
      'Everything starts as "stuff" in your Inbox — a raw item with just a title. During Clarify, the app asks: Is this actionable? If yes, is it one step (action) or multiple steps (project)? If it\'s a single action that takes under two minutes, do it now. Otherwise, you create an action with optional tags, dates, and a description. If it\'s not actionable, file it as Reference, park it in Someday/Maybe, or Trash it.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Moving Items Between Lists',
    description:
      'There are two ways to move items. From any detail page, use the "Move" dropdown to pick a destination — Next Actions, Today, Calendar, Waiting For, Projects, Someday, or Reference. Some destinations ask for extra information (a date for Calendar, a name for Waiting For). You can also drag items from a list directly onto sidebar menu items to move them in one gesture.',

  {
    title: 'Working With Detail Pages',
    description:
      'Tap any item in a list to open its detail page. There you can edit the title and description by clicking on them, add tags, set due dates and deferred dates, attach files, and leave comments. Navigation arrows at the top let you step through items without going back to the list. Action buttons at the top change based on the item\'s state — complete, move, trash, undo, or activate.',
  },

    title: 'Setting Up Your First Project',
    description:
      'A project in GTD is any outcome that needs more than one action to complete. Go to Projects and add one with a title and an outcome — "What does done look like?" Then add action steps from the project detail page. The first action becomes your Next Action automatically, and when you complete it, the next one in the backlog promotes to take its place.',

    title: 'Attaching Files and Adding Comments',
    description:
      'Every action, project, and stuff item has an Attachments section and a Comments section on its detail page. Attach files by clicking the upload area or dragging files onto it (up to 10 files, 50 MB each). Images and PDFs can be previewed in the app. Use comments to add notes, record progress, or leave context for yourself — each item supports up to 50 comments.',
