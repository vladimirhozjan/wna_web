    title: 'The Two-Minute Rule',
    description:
      'If an item takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately instead of tracking it. The overhead of organizing, reviewing, and re-engaging with a tiny task costs more time than just doing it. During Clarify, WhatsNextAction asks "Can you do this in less than 2 minutes?" — if yes, do it now and mark it done on the spot.',

  {
    title: 'Keep Your Inbox at Zero',
    description:
      'Your Inbox is a capture tool, not a storage bin. Process it regularly — ideally daily — by running the Clarify workflow. Every item should leave the Inbox and land in the right bucket: Next Actions, a Project, Calendar, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, Reference, or Trash. An empty Inbox means everything in your system has been consciously decided on.',

  {
    title: 'Do a Weekly Review',
    description:
      'The Weekly Review is what makes GTD work long-term. Set aside 30–60 minutes each week to walk through all your lists. WhatsNextAction provides a guided six-step review: empty your Inbox, scan Next Actions for anything stale, follow up on Waiting For items, check that every Project has a next action, review Someday/Maybe for items ready to activate, and look ahead on your Calendar. Enable it in Settings and create a recurring reminder so you never skip it.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Write Clear Next Actions',
    description:
      'A next action should be a concrete, physical, visible activity — not a vague intention. "Research venues" is weak. "Google \'event venues downtown\' and compare top 3 results" is strong. The clearer the action, the less resistance you\'ll feel when it\'s time to do it. If you find yourself procrastinating on an action, it probably isn\'t specific enough.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Define Project Outcomes',
    description:
      'Every project should have a clear answer to "What does done look like?" This is the outcome field on the project detail page. A well-defined outcome helps you recognize when a project is finished and guides you when deciding what the next action should be. Without it, projects drift and accumulate actions that don\'t lead anywhere.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Use Contexts to Work Smarter',
    description:
      'Context tags (@computer, @phone, @office, @home, @errands) let you filter your action lists by where you are and what tools are available. When you sit down at your desk, set @computer as your active context and see only the actions you can do right now. Add energy tags (energy:high, energy:low) and time estimates (min:5, min:30) to match actions to your current state. Customize your tag presets in Settings.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Use Today Sparingly',
    description:
      'The Today list is for actions you have committed to finishing today — not a wish list of everything you hope to get done. Move only a few items there each morning. If you consistently have leftover Today items at the end of the day, you\'re overloading it. Your Next Actions list is the backlog; Today is the short list.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Reserve Due Dates for Hard Deadlines',
    description:
      'In GTD, a due date means "this must be done by this date or there are real consequences." Tax filing deadlines, contract expirations, and flight departures are due dates. "I\'d like to finish this by Friday" is not. Overusing due dates creates false urgency and makes the real deadlines harder to spot. Use your Next Actions list and context filtering to prioritize instead.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Every Project Needs a Next Action',
    description:
      'A project without a next action is a stuck project. WhatsNextAction warns you when a project is missing one and nudges you from the Dashboard. After completing a project\'s next action, the app auto-promotes the next item in the backlog, but check regularly that the promoted action is still the right next step. During your Weekly Review, scan every project to confirm it has a clear, doable next action.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Use Comments as a Log',
    description:
      'Leave comments on actions and projects to record decisions, progress, and context. When you come back to an item after a few days, comments tell you where you left off and why. They are especially useful on Waiting For items — note what you asked for, when, and any follow-up details so you have the full picture when you check back.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Attach Supporting Files',
    description:
      'Keep relevant files directly on the item they belong to. Attach a receipt to a reimbursement action, a brief to a project, or a screenshot to a bug report. Having everything in one place saves you from hunting through email and folders later. For files that are not tied to a specific action, use the Reference file manager instead.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Move Items — Don\'t Let Them Sit',
    description:
      'If an action no longer belongs where it is, move it. Drag it to the sidebar or use the Move dropdown on the detail page. Waiting on someone? Move it to Waiting For. Blocked until next month? Defer it with a start-after date. Lost interest? Park it in Someday/Maybe. Items in the wrong list create noise and erode trust in your system.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Manage Your Sessions',
    description:
      'Check Settings periodically to review your active sessions. You can see which devices are logged in, how recently each was active, and end any session remotely. If you log in on a shared computer and forget to sign out, you can revoke that session from any other device.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Trust Your System',
    description:
      'GTD only works if you trust your system completely. That means capturing everything — not just the big things. It means processing your Inbox regularly instead of letting it pile up. It means doing your Weekly Review even when you feel on top of things. The moment you start keeping things in your head "just in case," the system breaks down. Put it all in, keep it current, and let go.',
